# What is this?
What the description says is pretty much it, this is a marathon written in Java and using Swing cause we were told to use only the standard library.
It was made by three people:
  - Fernando Sotelo (Animations and drawings)
  - Hugo Paniagua (Drawings and questions)
  - Diego Bravo (Code)
This was my very first approach working on a team project like this, i had so much fun tbh.
There are some things that can be improved but we only had about one month to make it while working on another 8 subjects at high school so we kinda rushed it.

# How to play
If you just wanna play download the compiled version, use any software to set up an MySQL database like XAMPP and import the .sql located in /resources/sql and configure all required settings (ip, port).


If you wanna compile it yourself or just look at the code then clone the repo and do whatever you want with it :).
